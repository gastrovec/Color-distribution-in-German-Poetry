The Mothers Welcome to her returning Sailor-Boy.


     
Welcome on shore again,
        Welcome once more again,
          Harry, my boy!
        Now all the care and fear,
        Haunting me year and year,
          Melt into joy!
Oft, when the thunder growled,
          Oft, when the nigthwind howled
            Round my safe Hall,
          Then I thought of my child,
          Tossed by the Ocean's wild
            Rising and fall.
Oft, when the stars did shine,
          O how my soul would pine
            For my blithe boy:
          Now God our Lord be praised,
          Who my fond prayers graced
            Richly with joy.
Calm stood my son and brave
          On the tremendous wave
            Of the fierce sea:
          Lo, now he save and sound
          Stands on his native ground:
            Welcome to thee!
Now for a long, long rest
          In the old eagle's nest
            Stayst thou with me:
          Knowst thou, where rest is best?
          Come to thy mother's breast
            And thou wilt see!
