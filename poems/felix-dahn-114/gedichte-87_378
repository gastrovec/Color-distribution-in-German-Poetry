The spirit of great William spake to me:
        »My messenger and herald thou shalt be!
        Go to the man, who of you Germans all
        Did of my language every whispered call
        Most deeply feel, most clearly understand:
        I greet him, tell him, from Olympian Land:
        He did not lose the labour of his love,
        Who to interpret all my beauty strove:
        Measure for measure I am wont to give;
        Immortal with myself his name shall live.«
